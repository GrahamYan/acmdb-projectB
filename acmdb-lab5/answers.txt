This lab is very difficult and it took me a lot of time in order to pass the "testBigFile" test. It also shows me how important to get everything secured in multi-thread tests. I created a java class named "LockManager" to deal with things collerating to locks.
There is an additional explaination I want to make. I just found out that the submition time has some problem. Since I used "git add --all" command every time, the submiting time of lab1 became that of lab2, and lab2 became lab3 and so on. I hope this will not affect the judgement of yours.
