First of all, this lab seems to be a really fundamental one for the whole Database Assignment. So I didn't do a lot of design decisions in this lab.
Secondly, as is clearly shown in the manual, the APIs are well designed, so I didn't change one.
Meanwhile, I've passed all the 35 tests, as well as the one in section 2.7. I also did some extra tests.
Last but not least, this time I used four days to finish this lab. Most of the time is used to learn how the B+ tree work and dealing with the bug occurred in spliting internal pages.
